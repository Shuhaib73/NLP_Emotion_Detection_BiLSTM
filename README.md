# Emotion Detection Web Application: Trained Bi-LSTM & GloVe for Emotional Insights üé≠‚ú®

Welcome to the Emotion Detection Web App! Harness the power of cutting-edge AI to detect and understand emotions from text. Designed for researchers, marketers, and data enthusiasts, this app leverages fine-tuned Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) networks with GloVe word embeddings to provide accurate and nuanced emotion classification. Fine-tuned specifically on a labeled emotion dataset, this tool allows you to classify emotions in text with high precision. Whether analyzing customer feedback, social media posts, or user sentiments, this app delivers actionable emotional insights. üåü

## üìñ **Features**

‚úÖ **Advanced Emotion Detection**: Classify text into diverse emotions such as Happiness, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Surprise, providing a deeper understanding of human sentiment.  
‚úÖ **Trined Bi-LSTM Model**: Built using a Bidirectional LSTM, the model is fine-tuned on an emotion-labeled dataset to recognize emotional cues in text. This allows it to better understand both past and future context in sequences.

‚úÖ **GloVe Word Embeddings**: Leverages pre-trained GloVe embeddings, which are fine-tuned alongside the Bi-LSTM model during training. This improves the model's ability to understand the relationships between words and their contextual meaning.

‚úÖ **Customizable & Scalable**: The modular architecture supports fine-tuning for additional emotion classes or integration with larger datasets.

‚úÖ **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Flask, HTML and CSS, the interface ensures a smooth and intuitive experience for all users.  

‚úÖ **Deployable Anywhere**: Containerized with Docker for consistent performance across environments.
